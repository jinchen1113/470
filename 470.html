      <h3>Costco’s Digital Dilemma: A Capability Strategy Challenge</h3>

      <p><strong>Topic: Capability Strategy</strong></p>

      <p>Costco Wholesale is one of the biggest membership retailers in the world. Shoppers love Costco for its low prices, bulk products, and surprise finds. Its private label, Kirkland Signature, is famous for giving customers great quality at lower prices.</p>

      <p>Costco leads the warehouse club market in the U.S., holding about 51% of the market, ahead of Sam’s Club (39%) and BJ’s Wholesale (10%). It also competes with stores like Walmart and Target, especially in groceries and household goods.</p>

      <p>But Costco is behind in online shopping and delivery. Walmart and Amazon have grown their digital sales and offer fast home delivery, while Costco’s online sales are still less than 10% of its total revenue. Walmart controls 25% of U.S. online grocery sales, and Amazon has about 23%. Costco is lagging behind.</p>

      <p>More and more customers want convenience. They like shopping online and having things delivered to their homes. Costco now faces a big decision: Should it invest more in its online store and delivery? Can it do that while keeping prices low and offering the same value in stores?</p>

      <p><strong>Can Costco stay on top in the next 5 years? Specifically, can it compete with Walmart, Target, or Amazon in online shopping and delivery?</strong></p>
