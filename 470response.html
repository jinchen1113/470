      <h2>Case Response</h2>

      <p>Costco is at a crossroads. As the leader in U.S. warehouse clubs with 51% market share, Costco’s strengths lie in its low-price, high-volume business model. However, its e-commerce sales remain under 10% of total revenue, while Walmart controls 25% of U.S. online grocery sales and Amazon 23%. To stay competitive over the next five years, Costco must strategically expand its digital capabilities without losing sight of its core value proposition.</p>

      <p>A key advantage that Costco must protect and leverage is its supply chain efficiency. With only 3,700 SKUs per warehouse, compared to the 30,000 typically found in a grocery store, Costco simplifies operations, increases supplier bargaining power, and reduces overhead. As detailed by <a href="https://dfreight.org/blog/costco-supply-chain-efficiency-sustainability/" target="_blank">Dfreight</a>, Costco’s streamlined supply chain supports a gross margin of just 11%, compared to Walmart’s 24% and Target’s 29%. This efficiency is the backbone of Costco’s low-price strategy and should guide its approach to e-commerce. Walmart, by using its 4,700 stores as fulfillment centers, has cut last-mile delivery costs by up to 50%. Costco operates over 800 warehouses globally, and repurposing them as micro-fulfillment centers could significantly lower delivery costs. By investing in its own logistics network, Costco can reduce dependence on third parties like Instacart and gain control over customer data and delivery times—essential for long-term success.</p>

      <p>Another major opportunity lies in expanding Kirkland Signature’s online presence. According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-built-56-billion-kirkland-120000770.html" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance</a>, Kirkland products generated $59 billion in sales in 2021 and now account for nearly 25% of Costco’s total revenue. Kirkland items are priced roughly 20% lower than national brands while maintaining comparable quality, building immense customer trust. This private label is not just a product line—it’s a differentiator. Costco should create online-exclusive Kirkland bundles and consider launching subscription services that deliver staple goods like paper towels, vitamins, or coffee on a regular schedule. This would replicate the bulk-buy savings of an in-store trip while offering the convenience today’s customers expect. Developing an online strategy around Kirkland’s brand strength could drive digital traffic and build Costco’s online identity, separate from competitors like Amazon, which struggles with consumer trust in its private-label products.</p>

      <p>Finally, Costco’s customer loyalty and high member retention offer a strong base for digital growth. According to <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/how-costco-has-managed-to-thrive-in-the-age-of-amazon/533741/" target="_blank">Grocery Dive</a>, Costco boasts a 90% renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada, driven by customer trust in its pricing, quality, and value. The company’s membership model contributed over $3 billion in profit in 2017, accounting for the bulk of Costco’s net earnings that year. However, as online competition heats up, Costco should enhance its membership offering by adding digital perks. Options could include free shipping for Executive members, exclusive online deals, or early access to online-only sales. Amazon Prime’s success—now with over 200 million members worldwide—shows the power of combining a membership model with digital convenience. By enhancing its program, Costco can increase loyalty, upgrade more members to its $120 Executive tier, and improve profitability in digital channels.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, Costco can compete with Walmart, Target, and Amazon in online shopping and delivery—if it builds on its supply chain efficiency, leverages Kirkland Signature’s strength online, and enhances its membership value proposition. By staying true to its core strengths while strategically expanding its digital capabilities, Costco can maintain its leadership position over the next five years.</p>
